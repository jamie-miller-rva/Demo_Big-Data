Demo Big-Data applications to include NLP

## Background:

The four Vs of big data are being used to determine when to migrate from regular data to big data solutions.

* **Volume** refers to the size of data (e.g., terabytes of product information). For instance, a year's worth of stock market transactions is a large amount of data.
* **Velocity** pertains to how quickly data comes in (customers across the world purchasing every second). As an example, McDonald's restaurants are worldwide with customers buying food at a constant rate, so the data comes in fast.
* **Variety** relates to different forms of data (e.g., user account information, product details, etc.). Consider the breadth of Netflix user information, videos, photos for thumbnails, and so forth.
* **Veracity** concerns the uncertainty of data (e.g., reviews might not be real and could come from bots). As an example, Netflix would want to verify whether users are actively watching the shows, falling asleep, or just playing them in the background.
